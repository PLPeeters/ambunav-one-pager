          <h1>AmbuNav Privacy Policy</h1>
          <p><em>Last update: April 19, 2022.</em></p>
          <h2>Personal information I hold about you</h2>
          <h3>Location</h3>
          <p>AmbuNav collects location data and stores only your last known position <i>on your phone</i> (there is no history).</p>
          <p>Location data <b>never</b> leaves your phone, since AmbuNav only communicates with the server to fetch the list of destinations. Distances are then computed on the phone itself.</p>
          <p>To access your location on Android, AmbuNav uses Google Play Services, which have their own <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy policy</a>.</p>
          <h3>IP address</h3>
          <p>AmbuNav indirectly collects your IP address when communicating with the server.</p>
          <h2>How your personal information is used</h2>
          <h3>Location</h3>
          <p>Your location is used by AmbuNav to sort destinations by distance when the app is in use.</p>
          <p>In order to notify you with useful information, such as the route to follow, the floor, etc. upon arrival, AmbuNav also accesses your <b>background location</b> for a duration of at most 1 hour after you start navigating to a TMS destination, or until you arrive at your destination, whichever comes first. AmbuNav is notified by the system only when you arrive in a 100-meter radius of your destination.</p>
          <h3>IP address</h3>
          <p>Your IP address is not actively used, but it could be to ensure the security of the server.</p>
          <h2>How your personal information is shared</h2>
          <h3>Location</h3>
          <p>Your location is never shared with third parties.</p>
          <h3>IP address and characteristics of your phone</h3>
          <p>Your IP address and certain characteristics of your phone (such as the model, its screen size, …) are shared with Firebase and Google Analytics so that they can provide me with statistics and allow me to react quickly in the event of app crashes.</p>
          <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
          <p>I may make changes to this policy at any time, so I invite you to consult it regularly. In case it changes, you will be notified through an update of the app.</p>
